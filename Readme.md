🤖 AI Voice Assistant powered by 🧠 GPT-2 + 🎤 Speech Recognition + 🔊 Text-to-Speech
Talk to your computer like a smart assistant!

This assistant uses SpeechRecognition to listen, GPT-2 to generate intelligent responses, and pyttsx3 to talk back — just like Alexa, but coded from scratch.

Let’s try a few commands:

"Hey AI, open YouTube"

"What's the time?"

"who is \_\_\_?"

"what is \_\_\_\_?"

It can browse the web, fetch Wikipedia answers, and chat using natural language processing!
